Unlike ordinary linear regression (OLR), which assumes a global association across the study area, GWR acknowledges and incorporates local variations in associations, providing valuable insights for policymakers to design targeted interventions based on localized data patterns.

A sample of 230 adult transgender who completed measurements of SC, SI, anxiety & depression and demographic information. Spearman correlation was calculated for scores of SC, SI and anxiety/depression. Bais-corrected bootstrap method using PROCESS for R was utilized for estimating the mediating role of anxiety/depression between SC and SI and role of age as an effect modifier in presence of the mediator."
