<span style="font-size: 20px;">
I'm a public health researcher deeply dedicated to <span style="color:#E95420">**health equity**</span> and <span style="color:#E95420">**social justice**<iconify-icon icon="hugeicons:justice-scale-01" width="20" height="20"></iconify-icon></span>. Currently, I serve as a Research Scientist at the <a href="https://buffettinstitute.nebraska.edu/" target="_blank" style="color:#E95420; text-decoration:none;">
<strong>Buffett Early Childhood Institute</strong></a>, where I collaborate with the Applied Research team to advance data-driven improvements in early childhood systems. My career has revolved around teaching public health courses, guiding graduate & postgraduate theses, and leading research projects. This trajectory has been shaped by a commitment to addressing health disparities faced by underserved communities.</span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">
My research interests span a wide array of topics, including <span style="color:#E95420">**spatial epidemiology**</span>, <span style="color:#E95420">**infectious diseases**</span>, <span style="color:#E95420">**health inequalities**</span> and application of <span style="color:#E95420">**mediation and moderation analyses**</span>.</span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">
My publication record demonstrate my ability to analyze large health databases like DHS, coupled with the proficiency in statistical programming languages including R, STATA, ArcGIS, and SPSS. With a strong commitment to <span style="color:#E95420">**diversity**</span>, <span style="color:#E95420">**equity**</span>, and <span style="color:#E95420">**inclusion**<iconify-icon icon="material-symbols-light:diversity-2-rounded" width="20" height="20"></iconify-icon></span> through my research and community engagement, I promote <span style="color:#E95420">**open science**<iconify-icon icon="fluent-mdl2:open-source" width="20" height="20"></iconify-icon></span> and embrace a growth mindset, always seeking to learn and apply new methodologies. Beyond my academic achievements, I am a strong proponent of work-life balance and gender equality.</span>
