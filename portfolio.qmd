## <span style="color:#E95420">Fifty Shades of Medical Research</span>

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
This presentation outlines the key components of good research practices. Here I emphasized the importance of reproducibility of research and ethical methods. Moreover, I discussed common misconceptions, such as the hierarchy of study designs, Simpson’s paradox, p-hacking, and stressing the difference between statistical and public health significance.

This web-based app works on the platform of Shiny application, which facilitates the evaluation of screening tools by calculating various diagnostic efficiency statistics. The app provides a user-friendly interface and is useful for researchers, healthcare professionals, or anyone interested in assessing the effectiveness of a screening test in a quantitative manner. The simplicity of the interface makes it easy to use, even for those without extensive statistical knowledge. [Check out the app here!](https://oraza.github.io/ScreeningApp/){target="_blank"}

## <span style="color:#E95420">GWR analysis: A statistical method to account for spatial heterogeneity</span>

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
In this study we introduced geographically weighted regression as a statistical method to account for spatial heterogeneity in data analysis. Unlike ordinary linear regression (OLR), which assumes a global association across the study area, GWR acknowledges and incorporates local variations in associations, providing valuable insights for policymakers to design targeted interventions based on localized data patterns.

In this analysis of childhood immunization in Pakistan, based on DHS (2012–13), we uncovered significant wealth-related inequalities in immunization coverage. The study emphasizes the need for policies that address both average immunization rates and inequality gaps.

## <span style="color:#E95420">Unveiling Pathways between Social Capital (SC) and Suicidal Ideation (SI) through Moderated Mediation Analysis (Unpublished work!)</span>

::: columns 
::: {.column width="55%"} 

Here we aimed to study the mediating role of anxiety/depression and whether age moderates the relationship of SC and SI among adult transgender in Karachi. A sample of 230 adult transgender who completed measurements of SC, SI, anxiety & depression and demographic information. Spearman correlation was calculated for scores of SC, SI and anxiety/depression. Bais-corrected bootstrap method using PROCESS for R was utilized for estimating the mediating role of anxiety/depression between SC and SI and role of age as an effect modifier in presence of the mediator.

In this session, I discussed the importance of medical research and highlights both its positive and negative aspects. I emphasized that good research should be reproducible with validated scientific, statistical, and ethical methods. I also introduced the "Four Horsemen of Research Apocalypse," which includes issues like ghost and guest authorship, research fraud, predatory journals, and salami slicing.
